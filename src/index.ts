  v6

  Design to disguise timing events as async functions of the
  Queue.

  That is, the Queue has blocking methods (like enqueue) that
  handle blocking until ready, rather than the stage doing this.

  Thus, the stages read more like how you describe a system in
  plain words.

  1. The event is added or rejected.
  2. Event goes into the queue to wait for a worker to free up
  3. The event is worked on.
  4. The work succeeded or failed.



  Within the Queue itself, the same is also true about describing how
  the queue works with words, within the enqueue() method.

  1. Add the event to an array
  2. Wait for it to be the event's turn
  3. Wait for a free worker to serve the event

  Thus, the enqueue() method returns a worker.
